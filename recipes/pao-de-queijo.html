    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups tapioca starch (such as Bob's Red Mill®)</li>
      <li>1 cup of water</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups shredded Mexican cheese blend</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with
        parchment paper.
      </li>

      <li>Pour tapioca starch into a wide bowl.</li>

      <li>
        Combine 1 cup water, vegetable oil, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a
        boil. Slowly pour over the tapioca, mixing with a spoon until evenly
        combined. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir Mexican cheese blend and eggs into the tapioca mixture. Knead dough
        until soft and sticky, 5 to 10 minutes. Add water, 1 teaspoon at a time,
        if dough seems dry.
      </li>

      <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 1 inch apart on the baking sheets.</li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden, about 25 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
